# Log - Code Meet-up Gambia - Abd Al-Ala Camara

## Week 1: 9 - 15 June, 2017.

**Week's Progress:**

Made a reusable mini HTML and CSS starter template to get up and running quickly on the projects. Included normalize css for cross browser consistency

Build the tribute page on top of the mini HTML and CSS starter template. Also added a Google font, Droid Serif, in order to have a beautiful type face. Tried as much as possible to use the appropriate (semantic) element for each content.  

**Thoughts:** 

Having a mini starter template at the inception comes in handy, gives me speed and also encourages re-usability of code.

Also learned that, commenting code forces you to really understand what that line of code is doing.
