## Introduction

The purpose of this code meet-up is to learn together by following the principles of **Learning-by-Doing**. We will be working on projects from freeCodeCamp (fCC) and also go through and complete fCC's curriculum. May Allah accept it from us

**This repo will be updated as we move on, please make sure to check back once a while.**

## How to get started
To get started, fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) weekly. Once you fork the repo, you can update the log.md file with your own content/details

## Rules
* You will log your weekly progress in the log file and push the log to GitHub at the end of every week.
* You will read the assign readings 
* You will heavily comment your code explaining what it is doing
* Stick to the project time-line.
* If you miss the weekly project, you buy drinks for everyone at the meet-up
* You will create a new repository for each project at GitHub and push your code there then share the link with us. Each project shall include a README file that describes the project. This description must:
    - Identify what part of the project have been correctly implemented and
what have not.
    - Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the project. Give credit where it is due, is very important for a Muslim
    - Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the
project.
